# Second-One
This is my second repository.
Pull requests are the heart of collaboration of GitHub.
When you open a pull request, you are proposing your changes and requesting someone to review and pull in your contribution and merge it to their branch.
You can even open a pull request in your own repository and merge them yourself.
